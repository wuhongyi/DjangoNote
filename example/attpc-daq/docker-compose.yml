# docker-compose.yml
# ==================
#
# This file describes the Docker containers that make up the app. For more information about the
# individual elements, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file.
#
# Some containers expect an environment file to be provided. This should have the following entries:
#
#     DAQ_IS_PRODUCTION=True   <-- Tells the system to use the production settings, rather than debug.
#     POSTGRES_USER=[something]   <-- A user name for the PostgreSQL database. Set it to something reasonable.
#     POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[something]  <-- A secure, random password that you will not likely need to remember.
#     POSTGRES_DB=attpcdaq  <-- The name of the database for PostgreSQL,
#     DAQ_SECRET_KEY=[something]  <-- A secure, *STRONG* random string for Django's cryptography tools.
#
# Since this environment file has passwords and secret tokens in it, **NEVER PUT IT ON GITHUB!**
